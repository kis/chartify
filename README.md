## Prerequisites
Before installing the Chartify package, make sure that you have a recent version of Node.js installed on your system.

Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)



## Installation
To install the Chartify package, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install chartify --save-dev

```
The above command installs the Chartify package and adds it as a dev dependency in your project. The "--save-dev" option indicates that the package is only required for development purposes and should not be included in the final production build.



## Integrating Chartify into an existing project
To integrate the Chartify library into an existing project, you will need to import it into your project and create a data array with objects that represent each data point.

Here is a code snippet to get you started:
 
```javascript
import Chartify from 'chartify';

const data = [{
xValue: '20.11.2016',
yValue: 5,
title: '007 Spectre'
}];

const config = {
theme: 'blue',
width: 50,
height: 10,
boxSize: 20,
isLineChart: false,
bordered: false
};

<Chartify 
 data={data} 
 container="films-container" 
 config={config} 
/>

```

The `data` array should contain objects that have three key-value pairs: `xValue`, `yValue`, and `title`. `xValue` and `yValue` should be of type `string` and `number`, respectively.

The `container` prop is a class that will be added to the chart container element. This is important in case you have more than one chart on your page.

The `config` prop is an object with properties that allow you to configure the look and feel of the chart. The properties include `theme`, `width`, `height`, `boxSize`, `isLineChart`, and `bordered`. You can choose the color scheme of the chart ("default", "blue", "grey","white", etc.), set the width ( length of X-axis) and height ( length of Y-axis) of the chart, specify the size of each box in pixels, determine if the chart is a line chart or not, and whether or not each box should have a border.
